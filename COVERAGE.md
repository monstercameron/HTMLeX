# HTMLeX Implementation Coverage Analysis

## ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
1. **API Calls & Data Collection**
    - All HTTP verb attributes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
    - FormData collection
    - Source attribute for additional form data

2. **DOM Updates**
    - All replacement strategies implemented:
        - innerHTML (with diff algorithm)
        - outerHTML
        - append
        - prepend
        - before
        - after
        - remove
    - Fragment processing

3. **URL State Updates**
    - push (query parameters)
    - pull (parameter removal)
    - path updates
    - history modes (push/replace)

4. **Signal-Based Chaining**
    - signal emission
    - listen attribute
    - trigger overrides

5. **Feedback States**
    - loading states (basic indication during API calls)
    - error states (basic error display on API failure - *Needs further refinement, see below*)

6. **Rate Limiting**
    - debounce implementation
    - throttle implementation

7. **WebSocket Integration**
    - Basic WebSocket connection
    - Message handling
    - Error handling (connection errors, message errors - *Basic, needs reconnection & cleanup*)

8. **Auto-Fire & Lazy Loading**
    - auto attribute
    - Delayed execution support (for prefetch, lazy)

9. **Caching**
    - Cache storage
    - TTL support

10. **Sequential Updates**
     - FIFO queue implementation
     - requestAnimationFrame usage

**Note on Error and Feedback States:** While basic loading and error states are indicated, the implementation currently provides rudimentary feedback.  The structured error fragment approach detailed in the specification (especially for streaming responses) needs further development for robust error communication to the user.

## üü® Partially Implemented Features

1. **Polling**
    - Basic interval-based polling implemented
    - Missing: Robust Cleanup/cancellation of polling intervals, especially on component removal or signal events.

2. **Error Handling - Refinement Needed**
    - Basic error catching implemented (primarily for network errors)
    - Missing:
        - **Structured Error Fragments:**  Implementation of the `<fragment status="...">` mechanism for server-driven error communication, especially for streaming responses.  Currently, errors are treated generically.
        - **Sophisticated Error Recovery Strategies:**  No automatic retry policies beyond the basic `retry` attribute, no circuit breaker patterns, limited options for UI-driven error recovery.
        - **Granular Error Feedback:** Error messages are basic and may not provide sufficient context to the user or developers.

3. **Retry & Timeout - Basic Implementation**
    - Basic retry count support
    - Simple timeout implementation
    - Missing: Exponential backoff, configurable retry delays, more nuanced timeout handling (e.g., distinguishing between connection timeout and server processing timeout).

4. **WebSocket Integration - Enhanced Robustness Required**
    - Basic functionality implemented
    - Missing:
        - **Automatic Reconnection Logic with Backoff:** Essential for reliable WebSocket connections.
        - **Proper Cleanup:**  Ensuring WebSocket connections are gracefully closed and resources released when components are removed or unmounted.
        - **`websocket:error` Event Publication:** Automatic publication of `websocket:error` event on connection failure (as per spec) needs verification and potential implementation.

5. **Lazy Loading - Basic Deferral, Lacks Viewport Awareness**
    - Delayed API call for `auto=lazy` implemented
    - Missing: Intersection Observer implementation for true viewport-based lazy loading.  Currently, "lazy" is just a timed delay, not actual viewport proximity detection.

## ‚ùå Missing Implementation

1. **Progressive Enhancement & Web Component Integration**
    - No explicit Web Component integration for custom elements interacting with HTMLeX attributes as defined in the specification.
    - No feature detection mechanisms to gracefully degrade functionality if HTMLeX is not fully supported or fails to load.
    - No fallback behaviors for enhanced elements in non-HTMLeX environments.

2. **Advanced DOM Diffing & State Preservation**
    - Current diff algorithm is basic, suitable for simple updates.
    - No optimization for complex DOM updates or large lists.
    - **Crucially Missing:** State preservation for media elements (`video`, `audio`) during `innerHTML` updates is not yet implemented, potentially leading to interruptions in media playback during DOM updates.

3. **Documentation Features**
    - No inline documentation within code
    - No JSDoc comments for API documentation generation
    - No TypeScript definitions for improved developer experience and type safety in TypeScript projects.

4. **Advanced Polling Controls**
    - `repeat` attribute for limiting polling iterations is not implemented.
    - No dynamic polling interval adjustments based on server load or network conditions.

5. **Extras (Inline Parameters)**
    - The `extras` attribute for injecting inline key-value pairs into API requests is not implemented.

6. **Timers**
    - The `timer` attribute for delayed event publication is not implemented.

7. **Lifecycle Hooks**
    - Optional lifecycle hooks (`onbefore`, `onafter`, `onbeforeSwap`, `onafterSwap`) are not implemented, limiting extensibility for advanced behaviors.

8. **Streaming & Progressive Rendering - Beyond Basic Fragments**
    - While basic fragment processing is implemented, true progressive rendering as described in the spec (sending "loading" fragments followed by payload/error fragments within a single HTTP response) and leveraging the Emit header for streamed updates is **not fully implemented**. The current fragment processing is more about handling static fragments within a standard response.
